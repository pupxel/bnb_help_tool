# B&B Help Tool

This is a Powershell script containing a small set of utilities to help out Bear & Breakfast users.

## To run it:
- Open [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pupxel/bnb_help_tool/main/b%26b_help.ps1) in a new tab.
- Hit Ctrl + S to save the script somewhere on your PC.
- Right click the file and select "Run with Powershell"

## Menu Options:
- **Generate Bug Report Info**
	This will create a data bundle that you can send to the game's developers in order to help them investigate issues.
	This bundle will be created on your Desktop, named "b&b_bug_report_info.zip".
- **Rollback Save**
	This utility will allow you to select backup saves for a specific Game Slot, in case something bad happens with your save file.
- **Nuke User Files**
	This utility will clear your save folder, erasing your progress completely. USE WITH CAUTION
	It is useful for players that played the B&B demo in 2021 and have the old saves format, blocking the game from opening a new slot at first run.
